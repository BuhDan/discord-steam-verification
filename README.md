> üöß This bot has **power** to kick or ban your users if they can't verify themselves. Please use it on your own risk and make sure to run some tests before using it on your server!

> Please make sure to read all of the README.md (this) file before starting to use the bot.

### ‚ùì How does it work

There's an API and bot, always in communicate with each other, they keep the data in a main class and reads data from there so everything is synced between bot and API.

When a user joins to your server, bot will check if they _somehow_ got the sucess roles. If they have it, bot won't do anything. But if they don't have the specified roles, it'll start the verification process and send the user a message including your API's URL.

The user will be asked to login to their Steam account and then they'll see this page:

![verification page](/images/verification_page.png)

The time they click "Yes", they'll send a POST request to another route and it'll send a request to Steam's API to get user's games list, and it'll try to find the specified application ID in user's library.

If API finds the application in their library, it'll fire a successfull verification event so bot will get the signal and continue the progress. If user doesn't have the game, same way API will fire a failure event and bot will check your penalty settings. It'll kick the user if it's set to kick and it'll ban the user if it's set to ban. Don't worry, you can choose not to do anything or bypass the user with `bypass` command.

When user that is in the verification queue leaves the server, they'll be removed from the queue automatically. Bot will notify you when user's DMs are disabled so you will know which users didn't get the message.

If API can't reach the data, it'll show an error box to the user with the message you specified to tell them that they got some issues with their profile (it's mostly caused when profile is set to private). **YES** user needs to have a public Steam profile so bot API can check the user's library.

That's all, but please do not forget this is not the "best version" of what you want. You may be looking for a better product but you're very welcome to contribute! I'll be looking forward to your pull request and bug reports! Please feel free to get in contact with me from [my website](https://eggsy.xyz) and check out m other projects too!

> ‚ö† **Caution!** This project has no database so all of you could easily setup and start using the project, you can edit your clone to have a database or wait for me to create another branch with a version that includes database connection. **Your verification queue will be lost unless you back it up with command or auto-backup feature** when you restart the bot or something happens. **And your settings won't be available** until you restart the bot! So make sure to set your config and everything, test it on a private server and then start using it on your main server!
